# Differentially Private Multi-Agent Constraint Optimization

Authors: Sankarshan Damle, Aleksei Triastcyn, Boi Faltings and Sujit Gujar

# TL;DR
We introduce P-Gibbs, the first differentially private DCOP algorithm that preserves constraint privacy. P-Gibbs builds on SD-Gibbs (Nguyen et al., 2019) and preserves constraint privacy using a novel sampling procedure. The sampling procedure combines sub-sampling, randomization through softmax and adds calibrated Gaussian noise to agent utilites.
